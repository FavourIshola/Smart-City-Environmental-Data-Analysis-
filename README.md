# Smart City Environmental Data Analysis
This repository contains a completed and graded university coursework project
focused on analysing environmental and traffic data for a smart city context.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project was to analyse traffic flow, air pollution (PM2.5),
noise levels, temperature, and regional differences to support data-driven
city planning decisions.

## Tasks Performed
- Classification of data types (qualitative vs quantitative)
- Descriptive statistical analysis (mean, median, mode)
- Analysis of data variation using ranges and histograms
- Trend analysis across time and regions
- Simple mathematical modelling to estimate PM2.5 levels
- Optimisation of pollution reduction strategies
- Interpretation of results for decision-making

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
